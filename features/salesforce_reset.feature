Feature: Salesforce Password Change

  As a College Track Portal staff,
  So that I canâ€™t send an email if the Salesforce password is outdated
  I want to have an admin-only page where I can update the security token and password

Background: There exists one authorized user and one authorized admin

  Given the following users exist:
  | name                 | email           | role  | password |
  | Admin                | admin@gmail.com | Admin | password |
  | User                 | user@gmail.com  | User  | password |

Scenario: User cannot reset Salesforce password
  
  Given I am on the login page
  And the Salesforce password is outdated
  When I login as "user@gmail.com"
  Then I should be on the login page
  And I should see "Your Salesforce account is invalid or outdated. Please update your password or contact and admin."

Scenario: Admin can reset Salesforce password
  
  Given I am on the login page
  And the Salesforce password is outdated
  When I login as "admin@gmail.com"
  Then I should be on the Salesforce password reset page
  And I should see "Reset Salesforce Password"
